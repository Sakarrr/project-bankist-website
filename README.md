# JavaScript DOM Manipulation Project

This project is a hands-on exploration of JavaScript and its capabilities in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM). Through this project, I've delved into various techniques and methods to dynamically update and interact with web pages.

## Features

- **DOM Selection**: Learn to select and manipulate HTML elements using methods like `getElementById`, `querySelector`, and `getElementsByClassName`.
- **Event Handling**: Implement event listeners to handle user interactions such as clicks, hovers, and form submissions.
- **Event Delegation**: Efficiently manage events for multiple elements using a single event listener on a common ancestor.
- **Dynamic Content**: Create, update, and remove HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Styling with JavaScript**: Apply and toggle CSS styles directly through JavaScript for dynamic visual effects.
- **Interactive Components**: Build interactive components like modals, tabs, and sliders using pure JavaScript.
- **Observer API**: Utilize the Intersection Observer API to efficiently handle events when elements enter or exit the viewport.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure and representation of the DOM.
- Gain proficiency in navigating and manipulating DOM elements.
- Learn to handle and respond to user events efficiently.
- Implement event delegation for optimized event handling.
- Utilize the Intersection Observer API for observing element visibility.
- Practice writing clean and modular JavaScript code for better maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page content.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout of the web page.
- **JavaScript**: For DOM manipulation and interactivity.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sakarrr/project-bankist-website
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Explore the different examples and interact with the components to see JavaScript DOM manipulation in action.
